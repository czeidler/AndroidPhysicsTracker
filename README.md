Lablet: Physics Experiments on the Tablet
====

Lablet leverages tablets (and smart phones) as experimental tools to perform real physics experiments. Experiments can be conducted and analyzed entirely on the tablet. Lablet is designed for use in lab classes, but is not limited to such. Lablet can run fully customizable lab activities to guide students through an experiment.

Camera Experiment
----

Lablet enables students to use the tablet camera to perform an experiment. For example, students can record a video of the trajectory of a thrown ball. To analyze the trajectory, students can step through the video and tag the ball in each frame. Using this data, the velocity and the acceleration of the ball can be calculated and even the gravitational constant can be derived. Students learn the relation between kinetic and potential energy. Furthermore, they see how the movement of the ball differs in the x and y directions.
Lab Activities (“electronic” lab handouts)

Lablet supports “electronic” lab handouts with information and instructions to guide the students through a complete lab activity. Teachers can widely customize a lab activity by editing a simple lab activity script file. Here, a rich set of components and layout options are provided, for example, text questions, check boxes or special components such as a sheet where students learn to calculate velocity and acceleration from the raw data.


Build
----
Lablet is developed using Intellij IDEA. If you want to build Lablet on your own best use this IDE since no other IDE or build system has been tested so far.
